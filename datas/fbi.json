            "details": "<p>Ida Dean (Richardson) Anderson, a 21-year-old white female, was last seen on September 18, 1958, in Ann Arbor, Michigan. She was due in court the next day for her parental rights case and was to be awarded custody of her children, but due to conflicting court documents it is unclear if she showed up. Ida had left her husband in March 1958 and was hospitalized soon after for various illnesses. As a result, her estranged husband placed their children in a boarding home and moved to Chicago while Ida was in the hospital. The state of Michigan took custody of the children and Ida had been fighting to get them back since she was released. Arrangements had been made for Ida and her children to fly to Florida to visit family after the September 19, 1958, court date but she did not show. Prior to her disappearance, Ida remained in constant contact with her family via mail. Anyone with information regarding Ida\u2019s disappearance is asked to contact the Ann Arbor Police Department.</p>",

His last communication with family members was in early April 1978 when he called an aunt, stating he was working on a shipping dock (possibly on the SS President riverboat) in New Orleans, Louisiana. Prior to his disappearance, he sent a postcard to his aunt from New Orleans saying he was doing fine. He has never been heard from again.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Doran was known to hitchhike, traveling across the country from California to Florida. He was a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, an avid guitar player, and liked to write short stories and poetry. He also carried a small pocket Bible with him. Fingerprints are available for comparison, and DNA from family members is in CODIS.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>",

The two had been at this location, which was extremely dark, for a short time, waiting for a friend, before falling asleep in the vehicle. Their seats were reclined and the vehicle was off. Both had recently left from a bar and had been drinking that night. While asleep in the car, the victim was awoken to a knock on the driver door window. The subject at the window identified himself as a police officer and began questioning the two about a possible DUI. The suspect requested the victim’s license, registration and insurance. The victim was directed out of the vehicle and brought to the rear of her car. The victim was further questioned and \"frisked\" on the inside of her legs and breasts. The suspect told the victim that because the keys were in the ignition, she could face a DUI charge. The victim questioned the suspect as to his name and badge number but was told to stop asking or she would be handcuffed and arrested. The suspect directed the victim to come with him to his patrol vehicle to submit to a portable breath test. The suspect walked the victim to a nearby alley where he pushed her against a telephone pole. The suspect first digitally penetrated the victim and then sexually assaulted (penile) her. The victim cried out, which her friend heard, and then the friend called out for her and the suspect ran off. The suspect fled from the assault area on foot.</p>",

When they arrived, they found the body of 28-year-old De’annzello McDonald.  Surveillance video showed McDonald walking up a flight of stairs with two men.  A fourth man ran towards them, and then ran away holding something in his right hand.  Based on information gathered to date, investigators believe the suspect to be a young Black man in his mid 20s, average height to 6’0” tall, with a thin frame and possibly braided hair.  The suspect was wearing a light, multi-colored top jacket, dark or black pants, and a light-colored hat.  He was seen getting into a blue or gray Ford Crown Victoria sedan.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
